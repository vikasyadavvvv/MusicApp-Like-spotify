I have developed a Music App similar to Spotify using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Leveraging Bootstrap has allowed me to ensure a responsive design, providing an optimal user experience across various devices.

To streamline development and enhance visual appeal, I integrated icons from Bootstrap Icons, which significantly reduced both time and effort. The app features vibrant jpg images and high-quality mp3 music files to create an engaging and immersive experience.

Key functionalities of the app include:

Music Playback: Seamlessly play your favorite tracks.
Forward and Skip Tracks: Effortlessly navigate through your playlist.
Volume Control: Adjust the volume to your preference with ease.
This project highlights my ability to create a polished, user-friendly music application, blending aesthetics with robust functionality.
